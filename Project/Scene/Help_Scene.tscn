Bullets that miss the enemy turns into rock by magical power of bat and limits the player movement

Every 10th bullet is powerful and injures the bat very badly

if you can break the white shield of the bat,in the end you turn your rocket into missile and tear through bat's body and kill the bat in cost of loosing your life. you become a martyr."
