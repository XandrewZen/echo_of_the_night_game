# echo_of_the_night_game
our submission for BUET CSE Fest 2023 Game Jam.

The theme was : "You Are Your Enemy".  
Our implementation: The player is in a mission to kill a bat-like devil.
The mother bat has a special power to convert your bullets into child bat but it reduces her life.
The mother bat can not hit the player directly but she can produce children which can deal damage to player if the player is in the red range. Therefore,
You are your own enemy.
Bullets that miss the enemy turns into rock by magical power of bat and limits the player movement
Every 10th bullet is powerful and injures the bat very badly if you can break the white shield of the bat,in the end you turn your rocket into missile and tear through bat's body and kill the bat in cost of loosing your life. you become a martyr.
